# GDPR-Compliant-DevSecOps-Pipeline
A complete CI/CD pipeline that demonstrates the understanding of both DevOps AND UK data protection law. Not just another vulnerability scan but building a pipeline that protects both the consumers' and the company.

## The Business Problem
UK companies face average ICO fines of Â£2.4M for GDPR violations. Most occur during software development when personal data is accidentally exposed, logged, or mishandled.

## The Solution
This pipeline implements "Privacy by Design" (Article 25) directly into the development process, automatically detecting and preventing GDPR violations before they reach production.

## Key Features
- Automatic PII detection in source code
- Data subject rights automation (erasure, portability)
- Audit logging for accountability requirements
- Retention policy enforcement
- Supply chain transparency for data processors

## UK Compliance Benefits
- Reduces ICO fine risk
- Demonstrates due diligence to auditors
- Automates Article 25 compliance
- Provides Article 30 documentation automatically
